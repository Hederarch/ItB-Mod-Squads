# Hedera's Squad Remix
The folder is now a valid modpack! Just extract the zip and put it right in the game's mods folder.

Feedback is preferred on the relevant channels of the official discord (or the specialized thread if that's still available): https://discord.gg/xRxPAb87JW

Check the Issues tab for known bugs that are being worked on.

*(also these do require the Into the Breach modloader. That shouldn't be a problem for most people but download it if you don't have it.)*
