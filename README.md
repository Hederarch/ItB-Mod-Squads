# Hedera's Public Testfire
Thanks for checking out my mods! These are my first attempt at modding Into the Breach, but I think they've turned out well and I'm excited to show them off.

They download as a single folder but they're meant to be used individually. The ItB Mod Squads folder itself is *not* a valid modpack.

Feedback is preferred on the relevant channels of the official discord (or the specialized thread if that's still available): https://discord.gg/xRxPAb87JW

Check the Issues tab for known bugs that are being worked on.

*(also these do require the Into the Breach modloader. That shouldn't be a problem for most people but download it if you don't have it.)*

## What's Included
This pack consists of 3 new squads and 1 new pilot.

The **Vek Stompers** are a remix of the Rift Walkers with weapons that encourage constant frantic movement around the board.

The **Frozen Flood** are a very dangerous squad whose advanced weapons quickly destroy the Vek but risk killing each other in the process.

A science mech which can create copies of itself.

The **Bio Butchers** are a squad designed to harness the raw material of the Vek, recycling it to armor and weaponry mid-combat.

![Saw Mech](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/429372540776087592/1016256673981145088/saw_demo.gif)

And the new pilot, **Apollo**, is an Old-Earth chess computer whose routines translate surprisingly well to mech combat.

![Apollo](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/429372540776087592/1006080844965879808/apollo.png)
He's a work in progress, not much to him mechanically yet but I think his dialogue is charming and maybe you will too.

## What to Look For

SPRITES - Are sprites aligned properly? Do they fit the art style? Do they look good in alternate palettes (Especially modded palettes)?

BALANCE - Are the squads overpowered? Do they hold up under higher difficulties? Are they fun to solve problems with? Are upgrades priced reasonably?

CLARITY - Are descriptions concise and comprehensive? Are weapons predictable and reliable? Is weapon targeting intuitive and comfortable?

CODE - Feeling brave enough to look through my hacked-together scripts? See room for optimizations or fixes?


I'll be updating these regularly, and I appreciate all feedback.
