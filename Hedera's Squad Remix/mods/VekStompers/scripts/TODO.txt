KNOWN ISSUES:

- Minor sprite offset errors, especially on _w, _broken, and _w_broken sprites
- Shadow errors, figure out Aseprite update to shear them properly
- Strange mistake in Driver Punch's TipImage, esepcially Prime_Driver_A
- Rework Driver Punch, too similar to Spring Loaded Legs
- Minor visual error, Crusher mech needs bigger shield (can this even be fixed?)

RESOLVED:
- Squad feels very bad to play, consider removing self-damage from Headbutt and convert to 2-range "pulling" punch 
	- Fixed, Headbutt is now Driver Punch, a leaping attack
- Bubble Artillery_B has inconsistent decisions on what is and isn't shieldable, refine Board: call
	-Fixed, check was on target instead of p2. Keep track of your loc values!
